%\label{sec:Quantum computing}
As computers get faster, we can solve some algorithms way quicker than before. But there are such problems and algorithms, that are not trivial, and solving them requires a lot of time and computing power that even with today's computers would take thousands of years to be solved.

That's where quantum computers come into place as they become useful for handling such problems. Quantum algorithms can achieve quadratic and even more significant speedups. We know several applications of this, one is searching in an unordered database or finding a period of a function.

There is a bottleneck in today's quantum computers. It is connected to their runtime possibilities as they can run only a certain amount of time due to coherency, leading to an algorithm's irrelevant outputs.
